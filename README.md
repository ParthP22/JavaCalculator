# JavaCalculator

A basic 4-function calculator created using Java Swing.


Update: 6/18/2024

This is a project that I created during my winter break after my first semester at Stockton University. It was my first ever real GUI app (I've made apps in MIT App Inventor and Code.org previously in high school). I made the entire project from scratch by reading documentation on Java Swing, and was quite proud of the outcome, despite it's minor bugs. The project began sometime in January 2023, and my final modifications were made on 1/10/2023. I did not know how to use GitHub back then, so none of my changes were committed, hence why I'm writing this in order to provide some history for this project. I also created a .exe out of it, so that way this calculator can be used as an actual desktop app. (I made this program in BlueJ, so there's some files that still need to be cleaned up).

The biggest issue with this project is not being able to continue calculations after you make your first one. For example, on a normal calculator, you'd be able to add/subtract/divide/multiply two numbers, and then immediately be able to perform another operation on the answer with another number. So, if you did 3 + 3 = 6, then you'd immediately be able to take that number 6 and do something like 6 * 3 = 18. However, this is a functionality that this calculator currently lacks. I may resolve these bugs and improve this app in the future.
